# CalcHash

A plugin for `fman` that computes the hash of the selected files and copies the results to the clipboard.

In slightly more detail: Select a file or files (not a directory or directories), press the assigned key (default is `F8`), and choose the hashing algorithm. Results will be copied to the clipboard.
